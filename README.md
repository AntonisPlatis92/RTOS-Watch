# RTOS Watch
Implementation of a watch/stopwatch in Prex

Prex is a portable, open source, real-time operating system for embedded systems.

In my project i created a RTOS that simulates a watch or stopwatch (depending on the chosen mode)

I ran it using QEMU, a simple-PC emulator. I used the script.sh file in order to load the proper image and then run it.

You can find the script ,the watch.c file & the final image in my repository
